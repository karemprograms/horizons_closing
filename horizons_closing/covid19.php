          Are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases
          in mammals and birds. In humans, these viruses cause respiratory tract
          infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses include some
          cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses,
          predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can
          cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary: in
          chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and
          pigs they cause diarrhea. There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to
          prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.

          are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense singlestranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical
          symmetry.
          [7] The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately
          26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses. They have
          characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which

          Coronaviruses were first discovered in the 1930s when an acute
          respiratory infection of domesticated chickens was shown to be caused
          by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Arthur Schalk and M.C. Hawn
          described in 1931 a new respiratory infection of chickens in North Dakota.
          The infection of new-born chicks was characterized by gasping and
          listlessness. The chicks' mortality rate was 40â€“90%. Fred Beaudette and
          Charles Hudson six years later successfully isolated and cultivated the
          infectious bronchitis virus which caused the disease. In the 1940s, two
          more animal coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible
          gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), were isolated. It was not realized at the time
          that these three different viruses were related.
        </p>
        <p class="content-part">
          Human coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s. They were isolated
          using two different methods in the United Kingdom and the United
          States.[21] E.C. Kendall, Malcom Byone, and David Tyrrell working at
          the Common Cold Unit of the British Medical Research Council in 1960
          isolated from a boy a novel common cold virus B814. The virus was not
          able to be cultivated using standard techniques which had successfully
          cultivated rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and other known common cold
          viruses. In 1965, Tyrrell and Byone successfully cultivated the novel virus
          by serially passing it through organ culture of human
          embryonic trachea. The new cultivating method was introduced to the lab
          by Bertil Hoorn. The isolated virus when intranasally inoculated into
          volunteers caused a cold and was inactivated by ether which indicated it
          had a lipid envelope. Around the same time, Dorothy Hamre and John
          Procknow at the University of Chicago isolated a novel cold virus 229E
          from medical students, which they grew in kidney tissue culture. The novel
          virus 229E, like the virus strain B814, when inoculated into volunteers
          caused a cold and was inactivated by ether.
        </p>
        <p class="content-part">
          The two novel strains B814 and 229E were subsequently imaged by electron
          microscopy in 1967 by Scottish virologist June Almeida at St. Thomas Hospital in
          London.[30][31] Almeida through electron microscopy was able to show that B814
          and 229E were morphologically related by their distinctive club-like spikes. Not
          only were they related with each other, but they were morphologically related to
          infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). A research group at the National Institute of
          Health the same year was able to isolate another member of this new group of
          viruses using organ culture and named the virus strain OC43 (OC for organ
          culture). Like B814, 229E, and IBV, the novel cold virus OC43 had distinctive
          club-like spikes when observed with the electron microscope.
        </p>
        <p class="content-part">
          The IBV-like novel cold viruses were soon shown to be also morphologically
          related to the mouse hepatitis virus. This new group of IBV-like viruses came to
          be known as coronaviruses after their distinctive morphological appearance.
          Human coronavirus 229E and human coronavirus OC43 continued to be studied in
          subsequent decades. The coronavirus strain B814 was lost. It is not known which
          present human coronavirus it was. Other human coronaviruses have since been
          identified, including SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV NL63 in 2004, HCoV HKU1 in
          2005, MERS-CoV in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019. There have also been a
          large number of animal coronaviruses identified since the 1960s.

          <b>1-Structure:</b> Coronaviruses are large, roughly spherical, particles with bulbous
          surface projections.[41] The average diameter of the virus particles is around
          125 nm (.125 Î¼m). The diameter of the envelope is 85 nm and the spikes are
          20 nm long. The envelope of the virus in electron micrographs appears as a
          distinct pair of electron-dense shells (shells that are relatively opaque to the
          electron beam used to scan the virus particle)[42][43]
        </p>
        <p class="content-part">
          The viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer, in which the membrane (M),
          envelope (E) and spike (S) structural proteins are anchored.[44] The ratio of E:S:M in the lipid bilayer is approximately 1:20:300. [45] On average a coronavirus particle
          has 74 surface spikes.
          [46] A subset of coronaviruses (specifically the members
          of betacoronavirus subgroup A) also have a shorter spike-like surface protein
          called hemagglutinin esterase (HE).
        </p>
        <p class="content-part">
          The coronavirus surface spikes are homotrimers of the S protein, which is
          composed of an S1 and S2 subunit. The homotrimeric S protein is a class I fusion
          protein which mediates the receptor binding and membrane fusion between the
          virus and host cell. The S1 subunit forms the head of the spike and has the
          receptor binding domain (RBD). The S2 subunit forms the stem which anchors the
          spike in the viral envelope and on protease activation enables fusion. The E and M
          protein are important in forming the viral envelope and maintaining its structural
          shape
        </p>
        <p class="content-part">
          Inside the envelope, there is the nucleocapsid, which is formed from multiple
          copies of the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are bound to the positive-sense
          single-stranded RNA genome in a continuous beads-on-a-string type
          conformation. The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid
          protect the virus when it is outside the host cell.

          Coronaviruses contain a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome.
          The genome size for coronaviruses ranges from 26.4 to 31.7 kilobases. The
          genome size is one of the largest among RNA viruses. The genome has a 5â€²
          methylated cap and a 3â€² polyadenylated tail.

        </p>
        <p class="content-part">
          The genome organization for a coronavirus is 5â€²-leader-UTRreplicase/transcriptase-spike (S)-envelope (E)-membrane (M)-nucleocapsid (N)-
          3â€²UTR-poly (A) tail. The open reading frames 1a and 1b, which occupy the first
          two-thirds of the genome, encode the replicase-transcriptase polyprotein (pp1ab).
          The replicase-transcriptase polyprotein self cleaves to form 16 nonstructural
          proteins (nsp1â€“nsp16).[43]
        </p>
        <p class="content-part">
          The later reading frames encode the four major structural proteins: spike,
          envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid. Interspersed between these reading
          frames are the reading frames for the accessory proteins. The number of accessory
          proteins and their function is unique depending on the specific coronavirus.
